## Introduction

Wordle is a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts. Each guess is scored based on how close it is to the hidden word, and the player's goal is to guess the word correctly within the given attempts.

This project aims to replicate the core gameplay mechanics of Wordle while providing a fun and interactive experience for players.

## Features

- **Word Guessing**: Players can input their guesses for the hidden word.
- **Feedback**: After each guess, players receive feedback on the correctness of their guess.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of attempts taken.
- **Hard Mode**: For players seeking a greater challenge, Hard Mode can be activated to increase the difficulty of the game.
- **Dark Mode**: Provides an alternative color scheme for the game interface, suitable for low-light environments or user preference.
- **High Contrast Mode**: Offers a high-contrast color scheme for improved accessibility and visibility.
- **Transfer**: Allows players to transfer their progress and settings across different devices or sessions.
